# NNDL_Project_2023Fall
This is the project and homework detail in the course Neural Network and Deep Learning taught by Jia Shi in Xiamen University. This course is based on [NNDL Tutorial of Xipeng Qiu](https://github.com/nndl/nndl.github.io). Most of the work are based on PaddlePaddle and TensorFlow/Keras. 

In HW1, basic models and principles of machine learning are introduced.
In HW2, forward neural network and several activation functions are discussed.
In HW3, CIFAR10 classification by TensorFlow CNN model.
In the Final, THE MNIST DATABASE classification by LeNet-5 based on TensorFlow.

And "课后作业", which means homework, is my solution of after-class problems.
